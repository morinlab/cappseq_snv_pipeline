# Sample list should be a three column TSV with 
# sample_name	/path/to/sample.consensus.bam	/path/to/sample.umigrouped.bam
# Where the former BAM is the one on which variant calling is performed, and the latter
# is the output of fgbio GroupReadsByUMI's step. 
# The latter BAM is used to generate review IGV screenshots of variants
# Comment lines must start with # and are ignored (see this entire preramble)
